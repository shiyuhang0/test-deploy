# AI Chatbot - Make everyone a prompt engineer

This is an open source AI Chatbot with [awesome prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) powered by [TiDB Serverless](https://tidbcloud.com/).

> This project is built based on [ai-chatbot](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-chatbot). Thanks for the great work!

## Features

- Awesome prompts for you to chat with AI.
- Share your chat powered by TiDB Serverless.
- Isolated chat (and the chat history) from different users.

## How it works

### Auth

Use GitHub OAuth App and [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) GitHub provider to authenticate users. 

### Chat & Prompts

The chat is powered by ChatGPT. [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) is used for streaming chat UI.

The prompts come from [awesome prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).

### Storage

Chat history, prompts and userID are stored in a TiDB Serverless. This provides:

- Share your chat with others and the chat history will be kept forever.
- Isolated chat from different users.
- Prompts management

### Deployment

The project can be deployed on Vercel.
